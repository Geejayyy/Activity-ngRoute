<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>	Welcome to my page! This was created for the Activity or Assignment that was given to us by our Subject Teacher. He had given this task in order for me to learn on how to use the directive ng-view for ngRoute.</p>
<p> First let us talk about myself. I have a crazy personality. I can act like the personality of a boy, it's actions and behavior. I can be like a girl but in short I could be my true self. The only one who could stop me or prevent me from acting like a guy is my mom. She loves to dress up her daughters like barbie dolls and of course there's me who could never refuse her. I want her to smile even tho sometimes she would throw away her frustations and anger towards me even though I did nothing to make her mad.</p>

<p>	I like things that are pretty and cool. What a girl or a boy has, I'd love to have both. The reason is I don't know why, I must be silly. I eat a lot especially when I was just a kid. I eat like a pig even if my stomach is full, I still eat because the food was delicious, who would dare to refuse to eat? Haha </p>
